## Welcome to the RAISE Lab @ Penn State


The RAISE Lab @ Penn State is a group of Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers that make foundational contributions to the field of Responsible AI for Social Emancipation; our goal is to advance the state-of-the-art in AI tools and algorithms to solve critical challenges faced by marginalized communities around the world, while ensuring that our algorithms do not exacerbate existing health/social/economic inequities in society.
